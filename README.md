## 🌐 Overview

This project was developed as a personal website to showcase my portfolio. It highlights my experience with:

* **React (CRA)** for the frontend structure
* **Three.js** for interactive 3D elements
* **Sanity.io** as a headless CMS for dynamic content

It served as my first attempt at building a professional online presence with interactive and modular components.
